## first page

This is my first page using this git-wiki system. Does it require that I give prose.io write access to all of my projects on GitHub? I don't think I want that.

How can I use this wiki system?
- maybe I can create a wiki for one of my classses.
- **How is this system better or more useful than GitHub's built-in wiki pages?**
- It would be nice to have a wiki for my hydrofunctions documentation
- but I use too many Jupyter notebooks to make this an easy option.
- Maybe it is possible to create a sub-folder of Jupyter notebooks and reference them.
- Then I would add notebooks as they were ready.
- They wouldn't be *automatically* added to the TOC.


A quick test of [links](https://hydrofunctions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Use the toolbar above, or click the **?** button for formatting help.
